# Radioplaylist
A repository for a quick investigation into which radio play which songs and when.
It specifically investigates Sky Radio before and after it becomes the Christmas Station,
which lead to a blog article on [sjoerdcornelissen.com](https://sjoerdcornelissen.com/2022/12/26/all-i-want-for-christmas-is-hearing-a-few-new-songs-sky-radio-plays-classics-on-repeat/)
